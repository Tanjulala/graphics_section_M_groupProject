OpenGL Graphics Project Proposal
Project Title:

Scenario-Based 3D Visualization in OpenGL

Team Members and IDs:

Muhshanat Hossain Tanjila – 23-52533-2

Tasnima Tabassum Sumaiya – 23-52511-2

Hridoy Mia – 23-51001-1

MD Symon Islam Jihan – 23-54263-3

Project Objective:

Our goal is to create a scenario-based 3D graphics visualization project using OpenGL. Each team member will implement a different scene representing a real-world location or structure. The project aims to demonstrate realistic modeling, texturing, lighting, and animation techniques in OpenGL.

Scenarios to be Implemented:
Team Member	Scenario	Description

1)Muhshanat Hossain Tanjila -	Switzerland	A 3D landscape of the Swiss Alps with mountains, snow, and greenery.

Switzerland Scene ------------

Current Features:

>>Mountains with snow caps 

>>Pine trees, grass, and fences

>>Chalets with animated smoke

>>Moving cars, buses, and a cable car 

>>Pond, fire, Swiss flag, wind turbines

>>Day/night cycle with sun, moon, and stars

>>Snowfall animation

Interactive Controls:

>>D / N → Toggle Day/Night

>>W / S → Increase / Decrease animation speed

>>I → Toggle Snow

>>R → Start / Stop Wind Turbines

2)Tasnima Tabassum Sumaiya -	China	A 3D representation of iconic Chinese architecture and scenery.

China Scene----------------------------

Current Features:

>>Traditional Chinese buildings

>>Roof tiers with gold rims and detailed windows and doors

>>Decorative lanterns hanging from buildings

>>Sakura-style trees 

>>Moving elements: boats on river, bus on road

>>River, fences, and grass 

>>Day/night cycle with sun, moon, and stars

3)Hridoy Mia -	Hills	A generic hill scene with mountains, trees, and a flowing river.

4)MD Symon Islam Jihan - Bangladesh	Sirajgonj Bridge	A 3D model of the Sirajgonj Bridge including road, river, and surrounding environment.
