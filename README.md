OpenGL Graphics Project Proposal
Project Title:

Scenario-Based 3D Visualization in OpenGL

Team Members and IDs:

Muhshanat Hossain Tanjila – 23-52533-2

Tasnima Tabassum Sumaiya – 23-52511-2

Hridoy Mia – 23-51001-1

MD Symon Islam Jihan – 23-54263-3

Project Objective:

Our goal is to create a scenario-based 3D graphics visualization project using OpenGL. Each team member will implement a different scene representing a real-world location or structure. The project aims to demonstrate realistic modeling, texturing, lighting, and animation techniques in OpenGL.

Scenarios to be Implemented:
Team Member	Scenario	Description

1)Muhshanat Hossain Tanjila -	Switzerland	A 3D landscape of the Swiss Alps with mountains, snow, and greenery.

Switzerland Scene ------------

Current Features:

>>Mountains with snow caps 

>>Pine trees, grass, and fences

>>Chalets with animated smoke

>>Moving cars, buses, and a cable car 

>>Pond, fire, Swiss flag, wind turbines

>>Day/night cycle with sun, moon, and stars

>>Snowfall animation

Interactive Controls:

>>D / N → Toggle Day/Night

>>W / S → Increase / Decrease animation speed

>>I → Toggle Snow

>>R → Start / Stop Wind Turbines

2)Tasnima Tabassum Sumaiya -	China	A 3D representation of iconic Chinese architecture and scenery.

China Scene----------------------------

Current Features:

>>Traditional Chinese buildings

>>Roof tiers with gold rims and detailed windows and doors

>>Decorative lanterns hanging from buildings

>>Sakura-style trees 

>>Moving elements: boats on river, bus on road

>>River, fences, and grass 

>>Day/night cycle with sun, moon, and stars

3 & 4) Hridoy & Symon : Bangladesh Sirajgonj Bridge A 3D model of the Sirajgonj Bridge including road, river, and surrounding environment.
Current Features:
    $Sky with gradient colors and animated sun rising/setting
    $Grassy area filled with trees, houses, bushes, dirt path, pond, and bench
    $Black road with white dashed dividers and five moving cars
    $Railway tracks with red rails, gray sleepers, and moving multi-carriage train
    $Layered mountain range with snowy peaks and additional hills
    $Complex bridge with gray pillars, supports, and sluice gates
    $Dam structure with concrete walls and gates
    $Blue water bodies including bottom water, dam water, and small pond
    $Moving boat on dam water with hull and rigging
   $Partial day/night mode toggle (sun for day, intended moon/stars for night)
    $Adjustable speed for all animations
    $Mouse controls for boat speed adjustment
    
Interactive Controls:
    $W: Increase animation speed
    $S: Decrease animation speed
    $D: Sunrise
    $Mouse Left Click: Increase boat speed
    $Mouse Right Click: Decrease boat speed
    $1-4: Switch between display views
