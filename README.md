OpenGL Graphics Project Proposal
Project Title:

Scenario-Based 3D Visualization in OpenGL

Team Members and IDs:

Muhshanat Hossain Tanjila – 23-52533-2

Tasnima Tabassum Sumaiya – 23-52511-2

Hridoy Mia – 23-51001-1

MD Symon Islam Jihan – 23-54263-3

Project Objective:

Our goal is to create a scenario-based 3D graphics visualization project using OpenGL. Each team member will implement a different scene representing a real-world location or structure. The project aims to demonstrate realistic modeling, texturing, lighting, and animation techniques in OpenGL.

Scenarios to be Implemented:
Team Member	Scenario	Description
Muhshanat Hossain Tanjila -	Switzerland	A 3D landscape of the Swiss Alps with mountains, snow, and greenery.
Tasnima Tabassum Sumaiya -	China	A 3D representation of iconic Chinese architecture and scenery.
Hridoy Mia -	Hills	A generic hill scene with mountains, trees, and a flowing river.
MD Symon Islam Jihan - Bangladesh	Sirajgonj Bridge	A 3D model of the Sirajgonj Bridge including road, river, and surrounding environment.
